## Installing

Please use the Steam Workshop. I currently have no plans of distributing releases via GitHub.

# Projects

## Free Energy Generator

This is just a little test for me to get into Harmony and ONI modding. It adds the generator available in debug mode while not needing to be in debug mode. 

Fancy stuff, surprisingly complicated.
